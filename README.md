# final-project (in progress)
This project was inspired from my previous experience in Social Work. The purpose of mhy app is to help people organize thier affairs in case of death such as, naming a trustee or trustee, a place to save DNR and End of Life decisions, what accounts need to be closed, what arrangements need to be made, etc. 

The user will create a login/password and compose a profile, and enter funeral arrangements. The user will also name a trustee and enter the trustee's email. the app will send an email to the named trustee informing them that they were named trustee and if they want to accept. If they accept, the trustee will make their own account and link their account with the person who requested them. This will make it easier for the trustee access the user's info when the user passes away.
